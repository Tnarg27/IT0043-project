            <p>
              Welcome to my corner of the web! I am a passionate 2nd year BSIT -
              Web and Mobile Application student at FEU Institute of Technology,
              specializing in creating dynamic and responsive web and mobile
              applications.
            </p>
            <h4>Who I Am</h4>
            <p>
              My name is Grant Paul Arnel P. Pamor, and I am enthusiastic about
              the world of technology and its transformative power. What started
              as a curiosity has blossomed into a dedicated pursuit of knowledge
              and skills in web and mobile development.
            </p>
            <h4>My Journey</h4>
            <p>
              Since embarking on this journey, I have delved into various
              programming languages, frameworks, and methodologies essential for
              crafting digital solutions. My academic journey at FEU Institute
              of Technology has provided me with a solid foundation, and I
              constantly seek to stay updated with the latest trends and
              technologies in the industry.
